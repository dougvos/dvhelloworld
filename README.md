A sandbox for Doug's experiments with GitHub and Netlify 

I'm following this GitHub Guide, here - https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ 
But my first test with Netlify was to use their fast-n-easy "drag your project folder" here thingy.

I'm Doug Vos, and you'll find me on many of the social's as @dougvos or sometimes @douglasvos
Back in the 1990's and early 2000's I learned a few things about HTML and CSS from Zeldman, 
and was one of the instigators of 'Blue Beanie Day' - to promote HTML/CSS 'Web Standards'.

For the past decade I've worked mainly with WordPress, however, my favorite computer languages are:
* Python
* Rebol/Red

That's all for now.
